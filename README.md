# Calculate ROI from AI Adoption in Streamlit (tested in macOS Sequoia 15.3.2)

The ROI calculation uses Monte Carlo simulation to calculate ROI based on the values assigned to the specified variables. To change a variable's value, simply move the slider. The application requires that you have a recent version of Python installed on your system. For download and instructions on how to install or update Python, see https://www.python.org/

You can run the AI ROI calculation in Streamlit as follows:
Open a regular terminal window (not a Python terminal) and type the following:

pip install streamlit

streamlit run [path]python_streamlit_ai_roi_calculator_mc.py

In Mac OSX, the easiest way to include the path to wherever you saved the file is to use a finder window. Open a finder window, locate the file, click once on the file to highlight, and drag the file's icon from the bottom of the finder window to the terminal cursor.
